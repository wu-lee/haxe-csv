Cooperatives have a model for doing so, and they have been demonstrating it for nearly two centuries. Around the world, thousands of individual cooperative initiatives are constantly appearing to offer new economic models and new development approaches that are respectful of the fundamental universal values. On every continent, cooperatives are vital because they respond to the current challenges and the needs of citizens by making clear choices in their actions.
